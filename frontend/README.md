# üöÄ Full-Stack Next.js + FastAPI Project

This is a full-stack web application built using **Next.js (App Router)** for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend. The goal of this project is to explore and integrate a wide range of frontend and backend technologies by building a scalable and performant full-stack solution.

## üìå Project Goals

- ‚úÖ Build a highly scalable, full-stack application using modern technologies.
- ‚úÖ Implement real-world features like authentication, file uploads, API integrations, and more.
- ‚úÖ Optimize for performance, developer experience, and clean architecture.
- ‚úÖ Continuously update this README to reflect project progress.
