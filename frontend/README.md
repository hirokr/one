# üåê Next.js Frontend ‚Äî Immersive Full-Stack Web App

This is the frontend of a powerful, full-stack web application built using **Next.js (App Router)**. The project integrates cutting-edge frontend technologies like **Redux Toolkit**, **Three.js**, and **GSAP** to deliver a fast, scalable, and immersive user experience.

## üí° Project Idea

The aim of this project is to build a next-generation, full-stack web application that demonstrates real-world usage of advanced frontend technologies. The app will be interactive, visually engaging, and optimized for performance ‚Äî suitable for both desktop and mobile environments.

This frontend will communicate with a **FastAPI** backend (handled in a separate repo), serving as the user interface for complex features like dynamic visualizations, authentication, data manipulation, and more.
